#### An analysis on Adidas sales in the US for the year 2020 & 2021.
From the interactive charts we're able to find out the below

- Bar charts on Sales by Store, Sales by State & Total Sales by Year
- Pie charts on Sales Methods, Product Sales & Total Profit by Retailers

These charts allow us to see data clearer and do comparison easily.

On the left side of the dashboard by using the slicer, we'll be able to filter out Products/States/Retailer and it will be reflected back on the Bar charts and Pie charts respectively.
On the right side of the dashboard by using the slicer,  we'll be able to filter the Year and Quarters of the Year to compare the sales.

# What have I learnt from this analysis?
- Based on the dataset, sales in 2021 is better than sales back in 2020.
- The most product sold for both years would be Men's Street Footwear.
- Highest sales by retailer: West Gear (most sales are done in-store).
- Lowest sales by retailer: Wartmart.
- Highest sales by state: New York.
- Lowest sales by state: Nebraska.
- Having an interactive chart helps doing analysis easier and faster.
- Have better planning/investment in future store location that most likely have higher sales.

# Changes made from raw data
- Data cleaning (Removing duplicate/blanks).
- Created pivot table.
- Added Interactive Charts.
- Added slicers to do comparison.



## Personal Thoughts
Having myself doing the interactive chart and doing analysis is interesting. It helps me see data differently. Rather than always sorting my data in Microsoft excel to calculate or see what I want, instead doing a pivot table and interactive chart helps me to view data faster even when new datas are added, I can just simply 'refresh data' and charts will be updated automatically which helps to do comparison faster and clearer.
